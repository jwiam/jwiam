# Hi, I'm Jiwon 👋

I am a web developer living in South Korea,<br/>
and I am interested in these things:

- Keeping up with web development trends 📈
- Designing better project architectures 🎨
- Analyzing traffic and using it as valuable information 📋
- Ensuring security 🔒
- Deciding whether or not to buy an Apple device 🍏
- Figuring out what to eat for lunch 🍔
- Reminding myself to work out... 💪
- And studying too... 📖✏️
